"""Hindi-specific hygiene gate for a translated tree.

check_translation.sh proves *structure*: same files, same labels, same
environment census. Its two prose gates are Latin-oriented and score nothing
on Devanagari -- gate 6 looks for TeX accent escapes (\\'e), which Hindi never
writes, and the drafty-"..." gate is script-agnostic. So a Hindi tree can be
structurally perfect and still be raw machine translation.

These are the failure classes the 2026-07-24 Hindi machine translation left
behind, each of which this script detects:

  1. residual English in visible text  -- \\text{ thousands}, TikZ nodes
     reading {tens} {units}, English chapter titles, English \\index keys.
     137 of 177 math bodies and 29 of 35 physics bodies carried these.
  2. transliterated English function words -- "द" for *the*, "ए" for *a*,
     "ऑफ", "एंड". A Hindi sentence never needs an article.
  3. Latin full stop where Hindi ends a sentence with a danda (।). The MT
     output mixed both, sometimes inside one paragraph.
  4. MT-injected spaces inside inline math -- "$P $ और $ Q $", which changes
     spacing in the output and is never what the English source wrote.
  5. a thin space splitting a number away from its noun -- the MT produced
     \\chapter{10 तक की संख्या\\,000} from "Numbers up to 10\\,000".

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_hindi_prose.py parts/grade-3/hi parts/grade-3/solutions/hi
    python3 tools/check_hindi_prose.py --quiet <dir> ...

Exit status is 1 if anything was flagged. Called by check_translation.sh for
lang == hi; safe to run by hand on a single directory while translating.

# REASON: a biology book prints nucleotide strands and residue chains, and
# both reach the `english` class as false positives that no translator can
# remove, because they are data and are identical in every language edition.
#
#   \texttt{5'-ATGGCTTAC-3'}  ->  LATIN_WORD is greedy over "-", so the token
#       tested is 'ATGGCTTAC-', which no longer fullmatches CHEM_FORMULA (the
#       bare 'ATGGCTTAC' does). 8 sites in parts/grade-10/03-universal-dna.
#   Met--Lys--Gly--Trp        ->  a chain of three-letter amino-acid codes; the
#       hyphens defeat CHEM_FORMULA. 20+ sites in grade-11/04-gene-expression.
#
# Deliberately narrow, so nothing English can hide behind either rule:
#   * the strand rule is UPPERCASE-only and needs 5+ letters, so the ordinary
#     words spelled from A/C/G/T/U (cat, act, tag, tact, gut) stay gated, and
#     the existing "uppercase and <= 4 chars" acronym escape already covers
#     the three-letter codon spellings;
#   * the residue rule needs at least TWO codes joined by hyphens and matches
#     the exact Xxx casing, so a lone 'His' or 'Met' -- and lowercase 'his',
#     'met', 'leu' -- are still reported. A chain that still contains an
#     English word (Met--Pro--stop) is still reported, which is the point.
