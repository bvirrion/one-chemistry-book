"""Gate 9 -- the twin-comparison prose gate, for editions written in the Latin
alphabet (fr, nl, es, pt, id).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Gates 5 and 6 are Latin-oriented but score nothing about
whether a fragment was translated; gate 7 (Devanagari, Arabic) works because
residual English is *visibly foreign* in a non-Latin script; gate 8
(Indonesian) works because a curated list of English words that are not
Indonesian words can be built. Neither trick is available for French, Dutch,
Spanish or Portuguese: an English word is spelled with the same letters as a
French one, and no word list can separate them cheaply.

So this gate does not ask "is this English?". It asks a question that needs no
per-language knowledge at all:

    IS THIS FRAGMENT BYTE-IDENTICAL TO ITS ENGLISH TWIN, AND DOES IT CONTAIN
    A LOWERCASE WORD?

A translated fragment that still equals the English one either was never
touched or is a proper noun. Proper nouns (Gauss, Thevenin, Bolzano--
Weierstrass, RLC) carry no lowercase word once math and macros are stripped,
so requiring one removes nearly every false positive without knowing a word of
the target language. The comparison is positional: the Nth fragment of the
translated file against the Nth fragment of its English twin, and it is
skipped entirely when the counts differ, because then check_translation.sh
owns the divergence.

WHAT IT COVERS -- exactly the classes that shipped green in real editions:

  title     environment optional titles (\\begin{definition}[Physical quantity])
            and \\chapter/\\section headings
  text      \\text{...} inside math, including the subscripts that no reader of
            the source ever looks at (S_{\\text{created}})
  node      TikZ/pgfplots node text, node[...] {...}, and axis labels
  dup       a line repeated verbatim from the English twin sitting immediately
            above or below its own translation (an applier misuse: the
            English line was kept AND translated)

Each class was a real defect in a shipped or nearly-shipped edition. The
Portuguese Book 3 edition carried three untranslated environment titles, one
duplicated English line, fourteen English \\text{} subscripts and one English
TikZ node -- all of them through a green check_translation.sh and a clean PDF.

DELIBERATE BLIND SPOTS. \\mathrm{} is mathematics and stays English across
every edition by series convention (S_{\\mathrm{created}}), so it is never
compared. Unit arguments (\\qty, \\unit, \\num) are mathematics too. A fragment
whose lowercase words are all in ALLOWED_IDENTICAL is skipped: those are
strings a Latin-script edition legitimately leaves alone.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_latin_prose.py parts/bachelor-1/fr parts/bachelor-1/solutions/fr
    python3 tools/check_latin_prose.py --quiet <dirs...>

The English twin is found by dropping the /<lang>/ path component, the same way
check_indonesian_prose.py does it.
