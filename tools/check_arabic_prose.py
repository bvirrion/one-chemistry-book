"""Arabic-specific hygiene gate for a translated tree.

check_translation.sh proves *structure*: same files, same labels, same
environment census. Its two prose gates are Latin-oriented and score nothing
on Arabic -- gate 6 looks for TeX accent escapes (\\'e), which Arabic never
writes, and the drafty-"..." gate is script-agnostic. So an Arabic tree can be
structurally perfect and still be raw machine translation.

The LaTeX reduction below is shared with tools/check_hindi_prose.py: it drops
technical macro arguments, keeps \\text{...} inside math, pulls the visible
strings out of tikz/pgfplots/circuitikz drawing code, and reports MT spacing
damage inside inline math. Only the language-specific classes differ.

Failure classes this script detects:

  1. residual English in visible text -- \\text{ metres}, TikZ nodes still
     reading {time (s)}, English chapter titles, English \\index keys.
  2. transliterated English function words written in Arabic letters.
  3. Latin , ; ? closing an Arabic clause, where Arabic writes ، ؛ ؟.
     (The full stop is NOT in this class: Modern Standard Arabic ends a
     sentence with the ordinary Latin '.', unlike Hindi's danda.)
  4. Arabic-Indic digits ٠-٩ in the sources. This edition writes ASCII
     digits so that a number in a sentence matches the same number in the
     mathematics beside it -- see arabic_style_card.md.
  5. MT-injected spaces inside inline math -- "$P $ و $ Q $".
  6. bidi control characters (LRM/RLM/LRE..PDI). Machine translation emits
     these constantly; they are invisible on the page, survive every other
     gate, and corrupt the term linker's word boundaries.
  7. Arabic presentation forms (U+FB50-FDFF, U+FE70-FEFF). Copy-paste from
     some sources yields pre-shaped glyphs instead of the standard block;
     they render acceptably and then break search, the index and \\omterm
     matching.
  8. tatweel (U+0640) used as padding.
  9. a thin space splitting a number away from its noun.

Usage:
    python3 tools/check_arabic_prose.py parts/grade-3/ar parts/grade-3/solutions/ar
    python3 tools/check_arabic_prose.py --quiet <dir> ...

Exit status is 1 if anything was flagged. Called by check_translation.sh for
lang == ar; safe to run by hand on a single directory while translating.
